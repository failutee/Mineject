**Mineject is a Framework that makes it easy to create projects for platforms such as Spigot, BungeeCord, etc.**
**The project that particularly inspired me was [EternalCore](https://github.com/EternalCodeTeam/EternalCore) by EternalCodeTeam, where they implemented the technique of dependency injection.**
**This being my first project of this kind, I acknowledge that it may not be perfect, but I'm still pleased with the final outcome.**
